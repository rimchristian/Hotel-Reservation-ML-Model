# Hotel-Reservation-ML-Model

### **Can you predict if the customer is going to honor the reservation or cancel it?**

### **Business Problem: The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customers' behavior.  
Reservations can get called off due to cancellations or no-shows.  Depending on the resuls, hotel managers should consider readjusting the feels that affect the reservation. I'm sure it ruins the customer flow from guest to guest**
